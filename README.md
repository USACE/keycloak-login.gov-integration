# Keycloak-Login_gov-IdentityProvider

## About
The software enables users of Keycloak (a modern open source identity and access management solution) to easily integrate with login.gov as an identity provider.

After configuring this plugin the standard Keycloak Browser Flow will show the "login.gov" authentication option.

## Compatability
Login.gov and Keycloak 8, 9, 10, 11, 12


## Build and Install
Compile the Keycloak login.gov plugin src by running: 

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Running with Keycloak on Host OS

Drop the `target/login_gov-<VERSION>.jar` jar file in the `keycloak-<VERSION>\standalone\deployments` directory.  
You may have to restart the Keycloak server for UI updates to take effect.

### Running Keycloak with Docker

To build a Docker Image with the login.gov plugin, from the project root directory run:

```bash
docker build -t keycloak:12.0.4 .
docker run -dt --name dev-keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8080:8080 keycloak:12.0.4
```

`Default Scopes` and `Authentication Context Class`

 4. Click `save` at the bottom
 
### login.gov
See configuration docs for [login.gov](https://developers.login.gov/oidc/) oidc clients.

 1. The `Issuer` field will be set to `Client ID` value in Keycloak login.gov Identity provider.

 2. Keycloak JWT X.509 certificate must be configured on the login.gov oidc client's `Public Certificate` field.  

    Get the X.509 certificate from:
    ```
    https://{{Keycloak_Host}}:{{Keycloak_Port}}/auth/realms/{{Realm_Name}}/protocol/openid-connect/certs
    ```

    Find the `x5c` property in the json response and copy the first string in the array.

 3. Make sure to set the `Authentication Context Class (acr_value)` to match what is set in keycloak:
 * LOA1 :  Self-Asserted - (NIST 800-63-3) Identity Assurance Level l (IAL) (default)
 * LOA3 :  Proofed  - (NIST 800-63-3) Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL)
